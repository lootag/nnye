export const title = "Our Mission";
export const intro = `Our mission is simple: we aim at creating an
ecosystem where users and advertisers can interact in a free and transparent
way. We wish to address what we think are the problems currently affecting
major social networks: censorship, hate speech, proprietary
recommendation algorithms and privacy.`;

export const tech = `We have decided to address these issues by creating a
specification that defines how a social network could operate in a decentralized
way. Furthermore, we have implemented this specification, in order to provide
free (as in freedom) software which users and advertisers can use in order to
interact with each other. However, unlike almost all other social networks,
nobody is forced to use the software we provide in order to participate in the
ecosystem: the software can be rewritten in any language, framework, and for any
platform, as long as it follows the nNye specification.`;

export const censorship = `On nNye, every user runs their own server, and
therefore every user is the sole owner of their data, unless they decide
otherwise. It naturally follows that the specification doesn't support any form
of censorship: users own their servers, and the servers are registered in a
blockchain, and therefore, in principle, nobody can prevent a user from posting any sort of
content, nor can anybody "ban" a user from the platform. 
It is possible to host your server on a machine owned by a
cloud provider, even though this is highly discouraged.`;

export const hateSpeech = `In order to prevent the spread of hateful or inappropriate
content, our company keeps a blacklist of posts and users. By default, the
software we distribute subscribes to our blacklist, however users are free to
unsubscribe from it: the blacklist is a product of our opinions, and we have no
intention of forcing it on others. Since the blacklist is part of the
specification, anyone can create one, and anyone is free to subscribe to any
blacklist they wish.`;

export const recommendationAlgorithms = `Since the software we distribute is
open source, you know exactly how content is recommended to you. By the same
token, if you're an advertiser, you know exactly how you're choosing the content
you're putting your ads on. We offer customization services to all the
advertisers who wish to target a specific category of content.`;

export const privacy = `The software as we distribute it doesn't collect any of
your personal data: you can check the source code by yourself and see that this
is in fact the case. You can decide you wish to sell your data, and we give you
the chance to do so by hosting data auctions. We employ your data in order to 
build artificial intelligence aimed at targeting ads to certain content.`;
