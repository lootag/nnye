export const title = "About nNye";

export const intro = `The best way to describe nNye is to say it is an
ecosystem aimed at decentralizing social media. The ecosystem encompasses
two main components: an open specification, which defines how the network's nodes
interact with each other; an open source implementation of the
specification. nNye lets you run your own server, and employs the Solana
blockchain in order to allow communication between users. nNye
offers you all the features that other major social networks do, and adds
blockcahin payments on top of them.`; 

export const servers = `There are two separate servers: a content
creator server, for those who wish to post and monetize their content, and an
advertiser server, for those who wish to advertise their products. The contracts
between content creators and advertisers are enforced by the blockchain. All the
software we distribute is free/libre software, licensed under the GNU AGPL: anybody can access, modify, and redistribute the source code.
Redistribution comes with a strict copyleft requirement: in other words, in
order to redistribute modified copies of the source code, these need to be
licensed under the GNU AGPL. We offer the option to get the software under a
commercial license for those who wish to redistribute proprietary builds of it.`;

export const hardware = `Our aim is make adoption as easy as possible, and
therefore our servers come with user-friendly graphical installers, in order to reach all
those users who are not willing to go through a command line installation. Our
software is written in Rust, a beautiful low level language which leaves a very
small footprint: this allows you to run the servers on any sort of hardware,
even a Raspberry Pi. We plan to distribute preconfigured hardware in the future
in order to facilitate adoption even further.`;
